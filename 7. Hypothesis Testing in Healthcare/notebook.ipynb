To promote transparency and reproducibility of the drug's outcome, they (GlobalXYZ) have presented the dataset to your organization, a non-profit that focuses primarily on drug safety.\n\nThe dataset provided contained five adverse effects, demographic data, vital signs, etc. Your organization is primarily interested in the drug's adverse reactions. It wants to know if the adverse reactions, if any, are of significant proportions. It has asked you to explore and answer some questions from the data.\n\nThe dataset `drug_safety.csv` was obtained from [Hbiostat](https://hbiostat.org/data/) courtesy of the Vanderbilt University Department of Biostatistics. It contained five adverse effects: headache, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, upper respiratory infection, chronic obstructive airway disease (COAD), demographic data, vital signs, lab measures, etc. The ratio of drug observations to placebo observations is 2 to 1.\n\nFor this project, the dataset has been modified to reflect the presence and absence of adverse effects `adverse_effects` and the number of adverse effects in a single individual `num_effects`.\n\nThe columns in the modified dataset are: \n\n| Column | Description |\n|--------|-------------|\n|`sex` | The gender of the individual |\n|`age` | The age of the individual |\n|`week` | The week of the drug testing |\n|`trx` | The treatment (Drug) and control (Placebo) groups | \n|`wbc` | The count of white blood cells |\n|`rbc` | The count of red blood cells |\n|`adverse_effects` | The presence of at least a single adverse effect |\n|`num_effects` | The number of adverse effects experienced by a single individual |\n\nThe original dataset can be found [here](https://hbiostat.org/data/repo/safety.rda)","metadata":{},"id":"59090772-03e5-4a43-a7c7-eebdfa709342","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Import packages\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom statsmodels.stats.proportion import proportions_ztest\nimport pingouin\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Load the dataset\ndrug_safety = pd.read_csv(\"drug_safety.csv\")\n\n# Create a countplot of num_effects vs trx\n# Store the output in plot_num_eff\nplot_num_eff = sns.countplot(x=\"num_effects\", data=drug_safety, hue='trx')\n\n# Set the x axis label and title\nplt.xlabel(\"Number of Adverse Effects\")\nplt.title(\"Distribution of the Number of Effects Between the Groups\")\n\n\n# Count the adverse_effects column values for each trx group\nadv_eff_by_trx = drug_safety.groupby(\"trx\").adverse_effects.value_counts()\n\n# Compute total rows in each group\nadv_eff_by_trx_totals = adv_eff_by_trx.groupby(\"trx\").sum()\n\n# Create an array of the \"Yes\" counts for each group\nyeses = [adv_eff_by_trx[\"Drug\"][\"Yes\"], adv_eff_by_trx[\"Placebo\"][\"Yes\"]]\n\n# Create an array of the total number of rows in each group\nn = [adv_eff_by_trx_totals[\"Drug\"], adv_eff_by_trx_totals[\"Placebo\"]]\n\n# Perform a two-sided z-test on the two proportions\ntwo_samp_z_stat, two_samp_z_p_value = proportions_ztest(yeses, n)\n\n# Round to three decimal places\ntwo_samp_z_stat = np.round(two_samp_z_stat, 3)\ntwo_samp_z_p_value = np.round(two_samp_z_p_value, 3)\n\n\n# Determine if num_effects and trx are independent\nexpected, observed, stats = pingouin.chi2_independence(\n    data=drug_safety, x=\"num_effects\", y=\"trx\")\n\n# Round the test statistics to three decimal places\nstats = stats.round(3)\n\n# Extract the Pearson row as pearson_num_effect_trx\npearson_num_effect_trx = stats[stats[\"test\"] == \"pearson\"]\n\n\n# Creating histograms to visualize the distribution of ages by treatment\n# Create the plot axes.
