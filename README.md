# Data Scientist Associate Certfication

Focus area: Data analysis using Python.

Period: Jan - Aug 2023 

At the end of the course, these are my ðŸ”‘ key learnings:
- Learn the data analysis process of wrangling, exploring, analyzing, and communicating data, and work with data in Python, using libraries like NumPy and Pandas
- Apply inferential statistics and probability to real-world scenarios, such as building supervised learning models
- Learn and use the most popular Python libraries for data science, including pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, scikit-learn
- Apply visualization principles to the data analysis process and explore data visually at multiple levels to find insights and create a compelling story.

Additionnally to this track, I completed "Object-oriented programming with Python" as well as "Data Engineering for Data Scientists in Python".
